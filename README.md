Drone Assisted Parking

Project developed at the Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal. 
In order to monitor the free parking parks at the university. 
With a click on a website, the drone takes off after the monitoring video is uploaded where it goes through an image analysis algorithm and writes the result into the information system.
